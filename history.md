# History

Open Podcast was born out of a personal need. [Wolfgang], one of the maintainers,
runs a podcast named [Engineering Kiosk](https://engineeringkiosk.dev/). While
setting up the hosting he realized that there are no great open tools for
hosting podcast. What he wanted was a way to get basic podcast analytics on a
self-hosted platform. The idea for Open Podcast was born.

Wolfgang teamed up with [Matthias] and received public funding from
[Media Tech Lab by Media Lab Bayern][mtl] to build a specification and
a reference implementation of the project.
