# Welcome to Open Podcast!

We build a new platform aiming to support the open and independent podcast
ecosystem. It solves one of the biggest challenges for podcast hosts to become
independent of big platforms such as Spotify and Apple: analytics and listening
behavior.

The Open Podcast Analytics platform is like a secret weapon for independent
podcast hosts, providing them with the powerful tools they need to take on the
big players in the market.

Our importer allows them to consolidate all of their data in one convenient
place, giving them a clear and comprehensive view of their performance.

## Basic Usage

The easiest way to use the platform is to run the [stack] repository. It contains
all components of Open Podcast and a script that runs the connectors as cron jobs.
More information in our [installation guide](/install) âœ¨.

We will also provide a hosted version of the platform in the future.
