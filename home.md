# Welcome to Open Podcast!

We build a platform for podcast analytics.
Our importer allows you to import your data from Apple and Spotify
and query it with SQL. We also provide a web interface to visualize the data.

## Why Open Podcast?

* **Pro Analytics**: We want to build **the best tool** for in-depth Podcast
  analytics &mdash; open source or not! You get full access to your data and you
  can run custom SQL queries and build your own reports. No compromises.
* **Full Ownership**: We believe that podcasters should own their data and
  analytics. We want to give them the tools to become independent of big
  platforms.
* **Better through collaboration**: Together we can build a better tool than
  proprietary alternatives because we can learn from each other and we are
  not limited by the business model of a single company. 
* **Open Source**: We believe in open source and want to build a community
  around the project. We are building the platform in the open and welcome
  contributions from the community. Join us!

## Basic Usage

The easiest way to use the platform is to run the stack repository. It contains
all components of Open Podcast and a script that runs the connectors as cron jobs.
More information in our [installation guide](/install) âœ¨.

We will also provide a hosted version of the platform in the future.
