# Welcome to Open Podcast!

In this project we build a new open platform aiming to support the open and independent podcast ecosystem. It solves one of the biggest challenges for podcast hosts to become independent of big platforms such as Spotify and Apple: analytics and listening behavior. The platform consists of three main components. The Open Podcast Analytics API is an open standard for podcast players. It is complemented by a reverse-proxy component to transparently collect data until the standard has been widely adopted. Furthermore, an importer allows the consolidation of analytical data provided by big platforms such as Spotify. This triangle builds a solid analytical foundation for independent podcast hosts to compete with big players on the market.
